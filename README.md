Online tic tac toe game!

Your pc acts as the server that hosts the game

Steps to run:

1. run Server.py
2. run Client.py on two terminals, or you can change the ip address in Server.py to your public ip address to allow incoming connections.
3. Play!

Functionality not added:
    - restart of game
    - scoreboard
    - name

Game.py used to be the local file I had used to test the functions of the game (runs single player)
